# Exact_shipment_location_data
A logistics company enters product information (such as origin, destination, and expected delivery date)
into the system and assigns a unique QR code to the product.
The system records the information on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of the
product's journey.

As the product moves through the logistics network, it passes through various freight hubs and checkpoints,
each of which scans the QR code and updates the system with information about the product's location and
status.
Once the product reaches its final destination, the logistics company marks it as
delivered in the system, and the consumer can now access the product's information
using the QR code.

The consumer scans the QR code using their smartphone, which launches the
application and displays information about the product's journey, including its origin,
transportation history, and any relevant certifications or quality control checks.

The consumer can use this information to verify the authenticity of the product and
make more informed purchasing decisions.
